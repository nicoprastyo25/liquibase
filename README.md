Liquibase helps millions of teams track, version, and deploy database schema changes. It will help you to:
- Control database schema changes for specific versions
- Eliminate errors and delays when releasing databases
- Automatically order scripts for deployment
- Easily rollback changes
- Collaborate with tools you already use

This repository contains the main source code for Liquibase. For more information about the product, see [the main project website](https://www.liquibase.org/).
